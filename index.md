_Hi, I'm Nina._ ðŸ‘‹ 

I've worked as an engineering manager at several startups, a product manager for Elizabeth Warren's 2020 Presidential campaign tech team, and an engineer and product manager at Microsoft. I sorta hate resumes, so this is my chance to talk about my work in the way I like.

You can see lots of examples of my work on:

* [campaign tech](/pages/campaigns.html)
* [tools for people who write code](/pages/devtools.html)
* [data](/pages/data.html)
* [writing](https://medium.com/@vyedin)
