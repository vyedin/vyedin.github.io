[...]. Much of our tech was open sourced after the campaign, and you can find a good summary of that effort on Wired and [Medium](https://medium.com/@teamwarren/open-source-tools-from-the-warren-for-president-tech-team-f1f27d2c7551).

Our campaign tech team was a phenomenal group of individuals. To hear their stories, check out [this episode of DevTalk podcast](https://kerry.lothrop.de/devtalk-41/) we recorded with my friend Kerry Lothrop after the campaign, and [this wonderful post](https://medium.com/@susangoldblatt/tech-on-a-presidential-campaign-an-overview-9679d69b2109) by one of our engineers. You can find other campaign projects on the Team Warren [Github](https://github.com/Elizabeth-Warren).

### Switchboard: Organize Your Community

Switchboard was a tool for distributed organizing. It's my favorite of all the projects I worked on, and both the [front-end](https://github.com/Elizabeth-Warren/supportal-frontend) and [backend](https://github.com/Elizabeth-Warren/supportal-backend) are open source!

When I first joined the campaign, I was told we had several hundred thousand volunteer leads who had filled out an interest form online but had not yet heard back from an organizer. This was both urgent and inevitable: it was critical that we connected with supporters as soon as possible and put them to work, but we didn't have the staff we needed in every state to organize all these people. To solve this, we needed to make everyone an organizer by empowering volunteers to connect with other Warren supporters in their communities. Switchboard was our solution to that.

We sent our best and most trusted volunteers to Switchboard, a web app where they could discover, connect, and keep track of prospects in their area. Switchboard would assign leads in batches to a volunteer based on their geographic location or the location of an event. Volunteers would call or text their prospects and if they made a connection, they could add the lead to their list of future contacts. 

The app was beautiful, simple, and easy to use. We used a passwordless login flow (we didn't want to be in the business of doing password resets), and volunteers could shift their prospects into Mobilize America events directly from the app. Volunteers could sign up their prospects for events directly in the app, I personally used Switchboard almost daily to recruit for debate watch parties, phone banks, and canvasses in my town. Thousands of volunteer prospects got their first outreach from the campaign via Switchboard.
