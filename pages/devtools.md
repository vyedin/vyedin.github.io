I was offered an hour to give any talk I wanted at the conference, and produced a short documentary on everyday people's relationships with their mobile apps and devices. It's an celebration of the way mobile has changed our lives since the first smartphone came out, and a look back on the market and the company we helped build.

It's called "If You Build It", and you can watch it here:

### Evolve 2014: Profiler

My first big project as a product manager was building a profiler for managed code to help Xamarin developers find and fix performance issues in their apps.  Watch me break down the product and why it's useful with my friend [@JamesMontemagno](https://twitter.com/JamesMontemagno) on Channel 9 or read the announcement blog post [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/say-hello-to-the-xamarin-profiler/).

### Microsoft: Installer, Visual Studio, and more

At Microsoft, I led the team that modernized the [Visual Studio for Mac installer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMXm43LVNeY&ab_channel=ProgrammingKnowledge). We upgraded the then 8-year-old codebase from xwt to a native Mac app (using Xamarin.Mac), improved install success by ~20% by rethinking first run experience and making downloads more resilient, and completed a full rebranding. 

I also contributed code to Visual Studio 2019 and Microsoft's [Mobile OpenJDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/openjdk).
